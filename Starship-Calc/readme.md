## Using the Calculator

### To begin your voyage simulation:

Input Parameters

- Acceleration:
- Enter in meters per second squared (m/s²) or in G-forces (G).
- 1 G ≈ 9.80665 m/s².

Distance:

- Choose from kilometers (km), astronomical units (AU), or light-years (ly).
- This is the one-way distance to your destination.

- Mass (Optional):
- Enter the ship’s mass in kilograms (kg) to calculate maximum kinetic energy.

### Outputs Generated

Ship Time:
- Time experienced aboard the ship during the voyage.

Earth Time:
- Time elapsed for stationary observers on Earth.

Maximum Velocity:
- Peak speed reached at the midpoint of the journey.

Maximum Kinetic Energy (if mass is provided):
- Calculated using relativistic energy equations.

### Controls
- Quick Fill: Loads a demo voyage with preset values.
- Calculate: Runs the simulation and displays results.
- Clear History: Removes saved voyage data.
- Export Data: Saves voyage history as a text file.
- Help: does the obvious
