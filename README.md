# VIBE SNIPPETS

These are small Vibe apps that some folks may find useful. I certainly do. Some are originals and some are others work remixed.

## Originals
- restyle.html is an image style transfer tools which produces a restyled form of a single image - try it http://restyle.puter.site
- masstransfer.html.  This is a batch tool does the same thing as restyler.html to a group of images - try it http://mass-transfer.puter.site
- Custom.html is a small app to make and save custom links
- upc3.html - universal printer component, part of anothe project. Can open files, print test directly with header or open a file from the url that calls upc3.html
- Planet-Generator2.html - neat planetery generator with gallery. Works but a few issues to sort
- lcars2.html - name says it all, work in progress. Next step is to make a better header
- LCARS-personal-log.html - note taking and ai generating personal log dressed up with TOS and TNG themes

## Warnings

These apps are entirely dependent on Vibe being up and working, all the ai smarts occur on the vibe server, so if it is down you are stuffed. Mind you this is no different to any online dependency, I felt it needed to be spelt out clearly. It's already happened to me once. 

## Enjoy

Peace and goodwill to all - except those old, greedy and stupid men causing conflict around the world, they can drop dead.
