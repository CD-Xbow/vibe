# VIBE SNIPPETS

These are small Vibe apps that some folks may find useful. I certainly do. 

## Originals
- restyle.html is an image style transfer tools which produces a restyled form of a single image - try it http://restyle.puter.site

- Custom.html is a small app to make and save custom links

## Remixes

## Use

- Download the file and deploy.
- They can be used locally or served

## Warnings

These apps are entirely dependent on Vibe being up and working, all the ai smarts occur on the vibe server, so if it is down you are stuffed. Mind you this is no different to any online dependency, I felt it needed to be spelt out clearly. It's already happened to me once. 

## Enjoy

Peace and goodwill to all - except those old, greedy and stupid men causing conflict around the world, they can drop dead.
